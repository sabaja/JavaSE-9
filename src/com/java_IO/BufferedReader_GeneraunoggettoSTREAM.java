/**
 * 
 * @author sabaja public Stream<String> lines() Returns a Stream, the elements
 *         of which are lines read from this BufferedReader. The Stream is
 *         lazily populated, i.e., read only occurs during the terminal stream
 *         operation.
 * 
 *         The reader must not be operated on during the execution of the
 *         terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal
 *         stream operation is undefined.
 * 
 *         After execution of the terminal stream operation there are no
 *         guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which
 *         to read the next character or line.
 * 
 *         If an IOException is thrown when accessing the underlying
 *         BufferedReader, it is wrapped in an UncheckedIOException which will
 *         be thrown from the Stream method that caused the read to take place.
 *         This method will return a Stream if invoked on a BufferedReader that
 *         is closed. Any operation on that stream that requires reading from
 *         the BufferedReader after it is closed, will cause an
 *         UncheckedIOException to be thrown.
